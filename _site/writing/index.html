        <p><p>Today today today. First Monday in NYC. I started my week long experiment of writing for an hour everyday. No constraints as to what should come out - a song, prose, or babbling nonsense and self loathing. I did a lot of writing in my new red journal. I wrote about it being the first Monday in NYC and how I seem to be somewhat obsessed with ‘firsts’ and new things because I can hype them up as times when I will change something about myself and be better and maybe even become the person I think I should/can/want to be.</p>

        <p><p>Thursday is a day of work outs and loathing. More self-loathing. More workouts. More creative explosions. Write more, and then be heard! If you speak louder than everyone else your chances go way up. Heck, Annie clark does it and she’s really really great. She makes people happy with her guitar playing AND her movies.</p>

        <p><p>Today was our first full day in NYC as proper residents. Taylor and I flew in from RDU last night and made it to our new flat in Harlem after the sun went down. We dropped off our luggage and went out to find a bite. Stumbled into Silvana and enjoyed live music, baba ganouj, and a sidecar. Immediately felt like home.</p>

<p>In an effort to calm and collect ourselves for the road ahead, Taylor suggested we host a concert this Sunday evening because she “thought people could use some soothing Spen voice.” So, we’re doing that. I’m going to prepare some songs to sing - some of my favorites, some that I’ve written, some that I’m writing this week, perhaps some that we can all sing along to.</p>

We found we had so much in common regarding design, product, digital etc.</p>
